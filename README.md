# Tensorized GRBM (TGRBM)
This repository contains the Python code for training the tensorized Gaussian Restricted Boltzmann Machine (TGRBM) using tensor decomposition techniques. The weight tensor of the TGRBM model is factorized using various decomposition methods, including Tucker decomposition, Canonical decomposition, Tensor Train decomposition, and matrix product operator..
